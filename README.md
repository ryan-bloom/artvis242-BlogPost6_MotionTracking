The piece that I found is less of a static art piece and more of a performance.  I spent time searching for artworks that used real-time motion tracking technology and this piece really captured my attention.  When I was watching and looking through some of the other pieces that I came across, which involved some dance routines and projections of light that followed those routines, it was difficult to determine whether or not the light show was static and the dancers choreographed their routine the match the show, or if the lights were actually reacting to the dancers themselves.  This piece, however, is very clearly using motion tracking to trace the paths of the pins being juggled.  The group of jugglers, known as Jonglissimo, have been studying and perfecting new ways to portray the art form of juggling, and have recently begin using real time motion tracking to do so.  The performance linked bellow was performed at a TEDxLinz event in 2018. 

In their routine, not only are the paths of the bowling pins tracked, but the rotation and speed of each pin is tracked as well, leaving an incredible display of art/lights on the blank canvas (wall) behind the performers.  What really stood out to me here, other than the skill of the performers, was the different types of motion tracking techniques that were used.  For example, during some parts of the performance, the tracks of the pins left a stagnant print on the wall behind the performers, while at other points in the performance, the pins' paths faded fast or even moved across or up or down the wall after being tracked.  I believe that this is done by changing the back end code that creates the tracking of the pins, some of the code leaves static markings while other parts of the code lead to the motion that is seen around the 1:50 mark of the video linked below.  The constant changin of colors adds to the entire aesthetic experience as well.  

This is the type of motion tracking art that really impresses and captures my attention because of the aesthetics that it creates as well as the performance that must be put on (live) in order to create such aesthetics.  While other artists' works allow the commoner (non-juggler) to interract with it in new and cool ways, such as Daniel Rozin's mirror works, I am drawn to the exciting colors and vibrant performances of groups like Jonglissimo. I will use this work to inspire my own, as I hope to be able to create some sort of motion tracking piece of artwork that allows users to interract with it by tracking their motion and leaving a subsequent trail or image on some sort of canvas that represents the motion that has been tracked.  This print might be stagnant or fading, but it will hopefully use the users' body to fill a canvas with color.
